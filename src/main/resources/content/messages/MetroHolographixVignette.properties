title=Metro Holographix
character.npc.name=Finn
narration=You're in a narrow canyon of impacted scrap in Metro Holographix when \
you meet Finn, the owner, whose head looks like it was designed in a wind tunnel.

## New tag names.
dialog.ds1.npc = Hey, kid! You need chips or software? I just got some new stuff \
from those bridge-and-tunnel kids in Jersey.
dialog.ds1.p.1=Yeah, Finn. I'm looking for some hot softwarez.
dialog.ds1.p.2=I'm just browsing right now.
dialog.ds1.p.3=I need a scan, Finn.  Then, maybe I'll buy something.
