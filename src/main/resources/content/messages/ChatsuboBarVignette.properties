title=Chatsubo Bar
character.ratz.name=Ratz
narration=You've just spent the night sleeping face down in a plate of \
synth-spaghetti in a bar called The Chatsubo. After rubbing the sauce out \
of your eyes, you can see Chiba sky through the window, the color of \
television tuned to a dead channel.  \n\nA PAX booth is on the wall. \
Ratz's prosthetic Russian arm whines as he wipes the bar. His teeth are \
a webwork of East European Steel and brown decay. 
dialog.ratz.ds1=I don't care if you eat that spaghetti or sleep in it, you \
still gotta pay for it. 46 credits.
dialog.p.ds1.1=Sorry Ratz. I can't afford it.\nWant me to give it back?
dialog.p.ds1.2=How about if I owe it to you?\nYou can trust me.
dialog.p.ds1.3=I'm ready for dessert. Have you\ngot any pudding for me to sleep in?
dialog.p.ds1.4=I'd like to sleep on it some more,\nif that's OK with you Ratz.

dialog.ratz.ds2=You been sleeping in that stuff all night. Now pay up or I call a Law Bot.
dialog.p.ds2.1="I'll see what I can do."
