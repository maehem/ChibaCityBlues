title=Cheap Hotel
dialog.0=Cheap Hotel smells of cigarettes and cheap perfume. The roof is made \
of thin laminated matting that rattles in the wind.  White fiberglass coffins \
serve as the rooms, stacked like surplus Godzilla teeth. Your coffin number 92, \
three meters long with an oval hatch at the end.  There is also a PAX booth here.
dialog.1=You're in the CHeap Hotel.
message.0=Management kicks you out for not paying your bill.
