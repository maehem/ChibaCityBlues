title=Crazy Edos Hardware Emporium
character.npc.name=Crazy Edo
narration=You're in Crazy Edos Used Hardware Emporium. Edo's eyes instantly light up as he recognizes you. A vast array of scratched, dented, twisted, and dusty computer hardware lines the walls.  Loose cables litter the floor. 

## New tag names.
dialog.ds1.npc= Hey! You said you'd bring me some caviar the next time you came in!
dialog.ds1.p.1=Did I say that? Sorry. Guess I'm not thinking too clearly. I spent the night sleeping in spaghetti.
dialog.ds1.p.2=Get your own caviar! Go squeeze a sturgeon! I'm no delivery boy!

## New tag names.
dialog.ds2.npc=For a can of caviar, I'll give you Comlink 2.0.  It's great software!
dialog.ds2.p.1=Fish eggs... on my shopping list!

## New tag names.
dialog.ds3.npc=Can I interest you in some hardware? Remember, my prices are much better than that pig, Asano, can do.
dialog.ds3.p.1=I'm just browsing.{exitPlayer}
dialog.ds3.p.1=Let me see what you've got.

dialog.ds3.npc=This is my current inventory. Of course none of the decks are cyberspace-capable.{showWares}
